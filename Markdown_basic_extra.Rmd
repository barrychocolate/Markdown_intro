# **The Cars Dataset**

This document will provide an overview of the cars dataset, a build in dataset within the R that can be used for practice.

This cheat sheet can be very useful for guidance <https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf>

## *Summary Statistics*

There are `r no_cars` cars in the dataset.

Below shows a summary of the overall dataset:

```{r cars, echo=FALSE}
summary(cars)
```

The first six rows of the dataset looks like this:

```{r preview, echo=FALSE}
head(cars)
```

## Including Datatables
Datatables can be a handy way to let the reader explore the dataset.  In this instance i have used the mtcars dataset as it has more data to view.  The [DataTables github page](https://rstudio.github.io/DT/) is a good starting point if you want to learn more.
```{r echo=FALSE}
datatable(mtcars,
          caption = 'mtcars dataset',
          class = 'cell-border stripe',
          rownames = FALSE,
          options = list(searching = FALSE)
)
```


## Including interactive plots
Where ggplot will insert a plot as a static image, plotly allows you to provide an interactive plot.  You can find out more about about plotly on the [plotly website](https://plot.ly/r/line-and-scatter/#new-to-plotly)

```{r plot, echo=FALSE, warnings=FALSE, message=FALSE}
p <- plot_ly(data = cars, x = ~speed, y = ~dist) %>%
  layout(title = 'cars plot')
p
```

## The US home of motorcars
Detroit is best known as the center of the U.S. automobile industry, and the "Big Three" auto manufacturers General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler are all headquartered in Metro Detroit.
```{r echo=FALSE}
m <- leaflet() %>%
  addTiles() %>%  # Add default OpenStreetMap map tiles
  addMarkers(lng=-83.0458, lat=42.3314, popup="The US home of the motorcar")
m  # Print the map
```

## Images
Adding images to your documents can be useful.
