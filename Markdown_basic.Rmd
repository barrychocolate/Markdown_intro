# The Cars Dataset

This document will provide an overview of the **mtcars** dataset, a built in dataset within R Studio that can be used for practice.

This [Markdown cheat sheet](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf) can be very *useful for guidance* when creating Markdown documents. 

## Summary Statistics

There are `r no_cars` cars in the dataset.

Below shows a summary of the overall dataset:

```{r cars, echo=FALSE}
summary(mtcars)
```

The first six rows of the dataset looks like this:

```{r preview, echo=FALSE}
head(mtcars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r plot, echo=FALSE}
plot(x = mtcars$mpg, y= mtcars$wt, main="Cars Data")
```
