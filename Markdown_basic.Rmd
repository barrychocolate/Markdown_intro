# **The Cars Dataset**

This document will provide an overview of the cars dataset, a build in dataset within the R that can be used for practice.

This cheat sheet can be very useful for guidance <https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf>

## *Summary Statistics*

There are `r no_cars` cars in the dataset.

Below shows a summary of the overall dataset:

```{r cars, echo=FALSE}
summary(cars)
```

The first six rows of the dataset looks like this:

```{r preview, echo=FALSE}
head(cars)
```


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r plot, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars, main="Cars Data")
```
